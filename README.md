# NYC Schools COVID Tracker

This is a small project meant for the purpose of aggregating COVID data pulled from the state's official school covid data.


# UNFORTUNATELY THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED.


# How does it work?

Every day we poll the COVID case data for numerous schools in the NYC region on the [School Health Report Card](https://schoolcovidreportcard.health.ny.gov/) website, provided by the state.

# Why does this exist?

We feel as if the provided website is lackluster and hard to check for a daily update on schools near you. Creating this allows us to get updates in a school server without having to manually check for the data.

# What programming lanugages/frameworks?

We'll use [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for data storage.
